                        Hi there! My name is AS-Irfani &amp; welcome to <strong>DEU.com</strong> My friend
                        johar and I co-own this website together. We both became interested in
                        fitness from a relatively young age, and when I began to learn
                        programming as a hobby, Jake convinced me to build this site because he
                        thought it would be a fun project! He was so rightâ€¦ I love running this
                        site and I LOVE reading all the email I get from folks saying how much
                        it has helped them. If you are one of those people I'd love to hear from
                        you too.
                    </p>

                        It might not seem like it, but DEU.com has thousands of lines
                        of code powering it and it's quite popular! Jake likes design and I do
                        all the coding as well as make sure the site is fast. If it's running
                        slow or you have any suggestions, please <NavLink className="a" to={'/contact'}>contact us</NavLink>.

                        At its core, DEU.com uses the <a className='a' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15883556/'>Mifflin-St Jeor</a> formula to
                        calculate an estimate of your <a className='a' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate'>Basal Metabolic</a> Rate, and then we adjust
                        the numbers to take your activity level into account.

                    <p className='txt'>
                        Optionally, if you fill out the body fat percentage field, the calculator
                        will instead use the Katch-McArdle Formula, which is the most accurate
                        formula of all. If you don't know your body fat %, you can pick up a pair
                        of cheap body fat calipers on Amazon, or find a place (try University
                        health departments) that offers DEXA scans. DEXA scans are the gold-standard
                        in determining your body fat percentage and generally cost between $50 - $100.
